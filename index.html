                    <span id="id3" typeof="Presenting">
                        <p>T: Today we are going to build on your knowledge of circuits by creating a circuit that will light up an LED light bulb. We will be doing this in a few different ways. How this will work today is that I will demonstrate what we will do, and then you will have the opportunity to work with your group to do the same thing. I need you to pay careful attention to the instructions as we go so we can be careful with our circuit materials.</p>
                        <p>A <strong>Conductor</strong> is an object or type of material that allows the flow of charge (electrical current) in one or more directions. Devices which perform an <strong>Input</strong> function are commonly called <strong>Sensors</strong> because they “sense” a physical change in some characteristic that changes in response to some excitation, for example using heat or force and converting that into an electrical signal. Devices which perform an <strong>Output</strong> function are generally called <strong>Actuators</strong> and are used to control some external device, for example movement or sound.</p>
                        <p><em>Show the electric light and switch example on the PowerPoint. Then, with an actual Snap Circuit set, demonstrate how to create a basic circuit that lights up one LED bulb and explain how it works with each piece that is connected.</em></p>
                        <p>When you close the slide switch (sensor), current flows from the batteries through the lamp and back to the battery through the switch. The closed switch completes the circuit – this is called a <strong>Closed Circuit</strong>. When the slide switch is opened, the current can no longer flow back to the battery, so the lamp goes out – also called an <strong>Open Circuit</strong>.</p>

                        <p>T: When you close the slide switch (S1), current flows from the batteries (B1) through the motor (M1) making it rotate. Place the fan blade on the motor shaft and close the slide switch. DC motors are used in all the battery powered equipment requiring rotary motion, such as drills, electric toolbrushes, and toy trains that run on batteries.</p>

                        <p>T: Some materials can carry the flow of electricity better than others. Try a paper clip for example, see if it can close the circuit. For example try a paper clip to see if it can close the circuit. When you place a metal paper clip across the terminals, current flows from the batteries (B1) through the alarm, and back to the battery. The paper clip completes the circuit and current flows through the alarm. You could also place your fingers across the terminals and the LED does not light. Your body has too high a resistance to allow enough current to flow to light the LED. If the voltage (electrical pressure) would be higher, then current could be pushed through your fingers and the LED would light. </p>

Your challenge over the next few days is to create something using SnapCircuits that will change the outcome of the story, and then retell your new version of the story.<br>Before getting into details, let’s think about this a little bit.<br>The outcome of the story, as you have presented with your textual evidence, is that the small fish was eaten and the big fish got his hat back.</p>
                        <p><em>(Some students may have argued that the small fish got away. You can state that as well as an outcome. Regardless, all should have agreed that the big fish did get his hat back at the end of the story.)</em></p>

                        <p>Imagine that the big fish was swimming along looking for a hat, he heard a sound or noise - How would this change the story? How would the outcome of the story been different?</p>

                        <p>T: Yesterday we read <em>This is Not My Hat</em>, mapped out the story, and thought about how we might change the outcome of the story by using light, sound, or movement.</p>
                        <p>Today you are going to finish your <em>This Is Not My Hat</em> Brainstorming graphic organizer and decide upon how your group is going to meet the challenge of changing the outcome of the story and retelling the story.  </p>
                        <p>Here’s that challenge exactly: </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Using snap circuits, create something involving light, sound, or movement that would change the outcome of the story.</li>
                            <li>Create a video of this new retelling of the story.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><em>Write these two points on the board.</em></p>
                        <p><strong>T: Now, remember, the circuit you create to change the outcome of the story has to make sense within the story. </strong><br>For example, if you are going to use a light to change the outcome, you can’t just have a light appear out of nowhere in the ocean. A light would have to come from a lighthouse, or from a deep-sea fish that has a natural light, or from a scuba diver holding a flashlight, or a search light on a boat, or maybe the light from an alien ship, etc. This book is a fantasy (because fish don’t really talk and don’t really wear hats), but it is still grounded in some level of reality.<br>A movement in the water has to come from some source- another fish, a whirlpool, a boat, etc. Because this book is a fantasy (fish don’t really talk and don’t really wear hats), but it is still grounded in some level of reality.</p>
                        <p>So, by the end of today, your group will have decided the device you are going to use and  begun creating the materials for retelling the story with the new outcome.<br>Use the next 15 minutes to finish your This Is Not My Hat Brainstorming Graphic Organizer. If you have questions, raise your hand and one of the teachers will come to your group. Feel free to use the booklets in Snap Circuit sets for ideas.</p>
                        <p><em>Let students work for 15 minutes and circulate the room helping if needed. If students are finishing, encourage them to go ahead and build the device with their Snap Circuits.

                        <p>T: Today we are going to revisit the story and discuss the way the author uses language in the story. Then you will spend some time working with your same group on your retelling of the story using some of the same techniques the author uses.<br>You will use the retelling script you create when you videotape your new version of the story tomorrow. Tomorrow you are going to create a video of your version of the story that uses your device and has a different story outcome/conclusion.</p>
                        <p>T: What do you think style means? (Students respond.) What do you think <strong>author’s style</strong> means?</p>
                        <p><em>Show slides for author’s style while discussing them with students</em></p>
                        <p>Author’s style is the way the author uses words and constructs sentences to tell a story.<br>Sometimes authors like to use really long sentences.</p>
                        <p>For example, this sentence is from Because of Winn-Dixie by Kate DiCamillo. She is talking about the dog, Winn-Dixie<br>“And then he crept up on the couch with us in this funny way he has, where he gets on the couch an inch at a time, kind of sliding himself onto it, looking off in a different direction, like it’s all happening by accident, like he doesn’t intend to get on the couch, but all of a sudden, there he is.”</p>
                        <p>T: Sometimes authors like to use very short sentences.<br>For example, this sentence is from You Go First by Erin Entrada Kelly. She is talking about a family conversation.<br>“Things were definitely weird.”</p>
                        <p>T: Sometimes authors use lots of descriptive words to create vivid images for their readers to see in their minds.<br>For example, this sentence is from The Epic Fail of Arturo Zamora by Pablo Cartaya. He is describing a manager in a kitchen restaurant.<br>“Martin was in an especially bad mood today and I could hear him yelling orders at the cooks. He waddled around like a hippo standing on two feet, and the mixture of highly perfumed deodorant and fried grease was making me queasy.”</p>
                        <p>T: And sometimes authors don’t give as many details so readers can imagine the story on their own.<br>For example, this sentence is from Dazzle Ships: World War I and the Art of Confusion by Chris Barton.<br>“Wilkinson’s responsibilities included patrolling the waters off southwestern England and sweeping for mines. He saw a lot of ships as part of his job.”</p>
                        <p>T: I am going to reread parts of This Is Not My Hat. I want you to pay attention to the words and sentences that Jon Klassen uses to tell the story. We are going to think about some of things we discussed the first day we read the story.<br>Begin rereading This Is Not My Hat.<br>Pause after page opening (spread) 2 and ask: “What do you notice about the sentences the author is using so far?” “Are they long or short?”</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>Short – 4 short sentences</em></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><em>Pause after page opening (spread) 6 and ask</em>: “What do you notice about the sentences in these pages? Are there any patterns that you notice? Are any words used over and over again? Which ones?”</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><em>Long phrases, “and even,” “probably won’t”</em></li>
                        </ul>
                        <p><em>Pause after page opening (spread) 9 and say:</em> “Did you notice how the pace of the story just became faster? Klassen put several sentences together in clumps so that the person reading aloud reads faster. Then he slowed the reader down on the next page by moving to one sentence that is on the farther opening. This is an example of changing pace and adding dramatic emphasis. We talked about that when we read the story on Tuesday. </p>
                        <p>T: <strong>When you do your retelling, you will want to use pacing like Klassen with short and then long sentences in order to build dramatic tension.</strong></p>
                        <p>Let’s also look closely at this image on the spread. <em>(Show page opening 9 again. Point to the picture of the big fish and the crab, and then to the words “So I am not worried about that.”)</em></p>
                        <p>Part of the reason why the pace slowed down here was so the reader would notice the contrast on this page. The reader notices the counterpoint—the little fish is saying there is no reason to be worried, but the image in the illustration is telling the reader that he SHOULD be worried. The words and the images are not the same.</p>
                        <p>T: <strong>When you do your retelling, you will want to use counterpoint like Klassen where sometimes the images will not match your words.</strong></p>
                        <p><em>Read on to page opening (spread) 11. Pause after reading this page.</em></p>
                        <p>Most of the time Klassen does not use vivid description in his writing because this is a picturebook and he can show the details in the illustrations. When he does use vivid description, it’s usually a reminder about something happening in the story. </p>
                        <p>Here he writes, “Where the plants are big and tall and close together.” He does this to emphasize that the little fish should be safe here. But it’s actually a hint to the reader that the little fish is not likely going to be safe.</p>
                        <p>T: <strong>When you do your retelling, you will want to use vivid details when you want to emphasize something in the story.</strong></p>

                    <p><em>Today students will think complete their retelling of the story, integrating their device that changes the outcome, and mirroring the author’s style in the original story.</em></p>
                    <p>T: Yesterday you created your script and then worked again on your scenery and device. Today you are going to finish all your creations, practice your retelling, and videotape it.<br>You will use one of the iPads to videotape your retelling. You must have a teacher check-off your script, your device, and your scenery before you can videotape your retelling.<br>You may only use what is written in your script. You cannot add additional dialogue or talking in your video.</p>
                    <p>T: You may simply use the regular camera on the iPad to videotape your retelling. If you are ready to videotape early today (in the next 30 minutes), then you can also choose to use an app called Adobe Spark Video. When you are checked-off, please let the teacher know if you would like to use this app.<br>Go ahead and begin working. Raise your hand for help, and come get a teacher as well when you are ready to check-off.</p>
                    <p><em>Students work on completing scripts and scenery, and practicing retelling. When they are checked-off as having a complete script, all scenery parts complete, and a device made and attached to the box, they can receive a iPad for videotaping.<br>Students who have extra time and are interested can review the PowerPoint slides for Adobe Spark Video and use that app to create their video.<br>By the end of the time block, all students should have completed their video. Final videos can be stored on the iPads and emailed to the teachers’ email addresses so that they can be uploaded and shared the following day.</em></p>
