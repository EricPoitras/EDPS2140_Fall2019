                    <p property="SupportingMaterial">Materials: Powerpoint slide presentation; Snap Circuits Jr. 100 kit (1 per 4 students); 2 AA batteries per group (Distribute batteries after the demonstration)</p>
                    <p>Note:  This activity builds on their knowledge of electrical circuits by introducing several different types of components</p>
                    <span id="id3" typeof="Presenting">
                        <p>T: Today we are going to build on your knowledge of circuits by creating a circuit that will light up an LED light bulb. We will be doing this in a few different ways. How this will work today is that I will demonstrate what we will do, and then you will have the opportunity to work with your group to do the same thing. I need you to pay careful attention to the instructions as we go so as we can be careful with our circuit materials.</p>
                        <p>Note: Demonstrate how to create a basic circuit that lights up one LED bulb and explain how it works with each piece that is connected.</p>
                        <p>T: A conductor is an object or type of material that allows the flow of charge (electrical current) in one or more directions. Devices which perform an “Input” function are commonly called Sensors because they “sense” a physical change in some characteristic that changes in response to some excitation, for example heat or force and convert that into an electrical signal. Devices which perform an “Output” function are generally called Actuators and are used to control some external device, for example movement or sound.</p>
                        <p>T: <em>(Show the electric light and switch example)</em> When you close the slide switch (sensor), current flows from the batteries through the lamp and back to the battery through the switch. The closed switch completes the circuit – this is called a closed circuit. When the slide switch is opened, the current can no longer flow back to the battery, so the lamp goes out – also called an open circuit.</p>
                    </span>
                    <span id="id4" typeof="Assess">
                        <p>T: You can practice on your own by trying to assemble the circuit and lighting the lamp by pressing the slide switch.</p>

                        <p>Notes: Elaborate further with additional examples of actuators.</p>
                        <p>T: When you close the slide switch (S1), current flows from the batteries (B1) through the motor (M1) making it rotate. Place the fan blade on the motor shaft and close the slide switch. DC motors are used in all the battery powered equipment requiring rotary motion, such as drills, electric toolbrush, and toy trains that run on batteries.</p>

                        <p>T: When you close the slide switch (S1), the circuit (U2) should start sounding an up-down siren. Switch the sound on and off quickly and see if you can create even different effects.</p>

                    <span id="id9" typeof="Presenting">
                        <p>T: Try adding and replacing the different types of sensors. Clap your hands close to the whistle chip (WC) or tab the base with your finger. Press and hold the press switch (S2) several times. Move your hand over the photoresistor (RP) and wave it.</p>

                    <span id="id11" typeof="Presenting">
                        <p>T: Some materials can carry the flow of electricity better than others. Try a paper clip for example, see if it can close the circuit. When you place a metal paper clip across the terminals, current flows from the batteries (B1) through the alarm, and back to the battery. The paper clip completes the circuit and current flows through the alarm. Place your fingers across the terminals and the LED does not light. Your body has too high a resistance to allow enough current to flow to light the LED. If the voltage (electrical pressure) would be higher, then current could be pushed through your fingers and the LED would light. </p>

                        <p>Note: Students set up with materials in group. The purpose of this activity is for students to familiarize themselves with their plan for retelling the story. Furthermore, the activity is also meant to help them think through their own plans in preparation for the MakerSpace activity where they will start building the scenery to retell the story.</p>
                        <p>T: Yesterday we learned about how light, sound, and movement can change the outcome of the story. Let’s spend a few moments reviewing your graphic organizer. By the end of today, you all should have some ideas in your group on what components in your circuit will be used to create either light, sound, or movement in order to retell the story in This is Not My Hat. </p>
                        <p>S: Students review their graphic organizer and discuss their plan.</p>
                        <p>T: What questions do you have about creating the scenery and characters or developing your retelling? What questions do you have about creating the devices you will use to change the outcome of the story?</p>

                        <p>T: Today we will begin working on the scenery for retelling your story. To do this, you can use the supplies and materials that are available at each table. We will do this in 3 steps:</p>
                        <p>T: First, we will add a scenery to your box</p>
                        <img src="assets/step1.png" height="300px" width="auto">
                        <p>Figure. Add Scenery</p>
                        <p>T: Second, we will create a circuit that will create the movement, light, or sound that we want to incorporate in our story. Add the circuit to any sides of your box using velcro for the circuit board. Remember that you can move the actuator using the jumper cables.</p>
                        <img src="assets/step2.png" height="300px" width="auto">
                        <p>Figure. Add Circuit</p>
                        <p>T: Third, we will video record your retelling the story and edit the video using Adobe Spark Video.</p>
                        <img src="assets/step3.png" height="300px" width="auto">
                        <p>Figure. Video Record Retelling the Story</p>
                        <p>Note: <a href="https://youtu.be/XzC2-8LN5Gk">Show video example of the final step in the process.</a></p>
                        <p>T: Let’s start working on the scenery. If you need help, raise your hands and we can come around and help you. Once you have set up your box, move ahead to building your own circuit or practice retelling the story by writing what you will say and at what moment you want to incorporate light, sound, or movement.</p>

                        <p>Notes: The purpose of this activity is for students to think critically about their own retelling by analyzing and applying notions related to author style. </p>
                        <p>T: Today we are going to reread this story and discuss the way the author uses language in the story. Then you will spend some time working with your same group to revise writing your retelling of the story using some of the same techniques the author uses. </p>
                        <p>T: <em>(Begins reading the book aloud)</em> Before we begin reading, can anyone tell me what style means? So what do you think author’s style means?</p>
                        <p>T: Author’s style is the way the author uses words and constructs sentences to tell the story. Sometimes authors like to use really long sentences. [Show example.] Sometimes authors like to use very short sentences. [Show example.]  Sometimes authors use lots of descriptive words to create vivid images for their readers to see in their minds. [Show example.] And sometimes authors don’t give as many details so  readers can imagine the story on their own. [Show example.] Today while we read, I want you to pay attention to the words and sentences that Jon Klassen uses to tell the story. </p>
                        <p>Notes: Rely on several instructional strategies for them to understand author's style and how it applies to their efforts to retell their stories</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pause after page 4 and ask: “What do you notice about the sentences the author is using so far?” Are they long or short? </li>
                            <li>Pause after page 12 and ask: “What do you notice about the sentences in these pages? Are there any patterns that you notice? Are any words used over and over again? Which ones?” </li>
                            <li>Pause after page 18 and ask: “What have you been noticing about the words the author uses? Does he give us lots of details or does he let us imagine the story on our own?”</li>
                            <li>Model some of the style and devices the author uses. Ask students to try some of them out on lined paper or a graphic organizer. </li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>And even if ______________________, he probably ________________________. </li>
                                <li>But I will _________________________. </li>
                                <li>So I ________________________________. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>T: With your group, revise writing your retelling of the story and implement some of the style and devices the author uses into your writing.</p>
                            <p>Notes: Begin to revise their retelling by visiting each group and prompting them to incorporate the style and devices of the author (e.g., What part of the new story did you like? What part of the new story did you want more information or details? Does the retelling feel like it fits with the author’s writing?). Share their retelling with another group and get feedback (if time permits).</p>

                        <p>Note: Continue work on their MakerSpace activity. Help them with creating the background, cutting out their characters, attaching the circuit board and actuator, plan how the circuit will be incorporated in the retelling of the story, and so on.</p>
