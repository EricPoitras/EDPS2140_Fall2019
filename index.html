                    <p>Note:  This activity builds on their knowledge of electrical circuits by introducing several different types of components</p>
                    <span id="id3" typeof="Presenting">
                        <p>T: Today we are going to build on your knowledge of circuits by creating a circuit that will light up an LED light bulb. We will be doing this in a few different ways. How this will work today is that I will demonstrate what we will do, and then you will have the opportunity to work with your group to do the same thing. I need you to pay careful attention to the instructions as we go so as we can be careful with our circuit materials.</p>
                        <p>Note: Demonstrate how to create a basic circuit that lights up one LED bulb and explain how it works with each piece that is connected.</p>
                        <p>T: A conductor is an object or type of material that allows the flow of charge (electrical current) in one or more directions. Devices which perform an “Input” function are commonly called Sensors because they “sense” a physical change in some characteristic that changes in response to some excitation, for example heat or force and convert that into an electrical signal. Devices which perform an “Output” function are generally called Actuators and are used to control some external device, for example movement or sound.</p>
                        <p>T: <em>(Show the electric light and switch example)</em> When you close the slide switch (sensor), current flows from the batteries through the lamp and back to the battery through the switch. The closed switch completes the circuit – this is called a closed circuit. When the slide switch is opened, the current can no longer flow back to the battery, so the lamp goes out – also called an open circuit.</p>
                    </span>
                    <span id="id4" typeof="Assess">
                        <p>T: You can practice on your own by trying to assemble the circuit and lighting the lamp by pressing the slide switch.</p>

                        <p>Notes: Elaborate further with additional examples of actuators.</p>
                        <p>T: When you close the slide switch (S1), current flows from the batteries (B1) through the motor (M1) making it rotate. Place the fan blade on the motor shaft and close the slide switch. DC motors are used in all the battery powered equipment requiring rotary motion, such as drills, electric toolbrush, and toy trains that run on batteries.</p>

                    <span id="id9" typeof="Presenting">
                        <p>T: Try adding and replacing the different types of sensors. Clap your hands close to the whistle chip (WC) or tab the base with your finger. Press and hold the press switch (S2) several times. Move your hand over the photoresistor (RP) and wave it.</p>

                    <span id="id11" typeof="Presenting">
                        <p>T: Some materials can carry the flow of electricity better than others. Try a paper clip for example, see if it can close the circuit. When you place a metal paper clip across the terminals, current flows from the batteries (B1) through the alarm, and back to the battery. The paper clip completes the circuit and current flows through the alarm. Place your fingers across the terminals and the LED does not light. Your body has too high a resistance to allow enough current to flow to light the LED. If the voltage (electrical pressure) would be higher, then current could be pushed through your fingers and the LED would light. </p>

Your challenge over the next few days is to create something using SnapCircuits that will change the outcome of the story, and then retell your new version of the story.<br>Before getting into details, let’s think about this a little bit.<br>The outcome of the story, as you have presented with your textual evidence, is that the small fish was eaten and the big fish got his hat back.</p>
                        <p><em>(Some students may have argued that the small fish got away. You can state that as well as an outcome. Regardless, all should have agreed that the big fish did get his hat back at the end of the story.)</em></p>

                        <p>T: Imagine that the big fish was swimming along looking for a hat, he heard a sound or noise - How would this change the story? How would the outcome of the story been different?</p>
                        <p>T: Imagine that while the big fish was swimming along looking for his hat, he saw a light - How would this change the story? How would the outcome of the story been different?</p>
                        <p>T: Imagine that while the big fish was swimming along looking for his hat, he felt something move - How would this change the story? How would the outcome of the story been different?</p>

                        <p>T: You all know this story well. Now let’s turn to our challenge. </p>       
                        <p>T: <em>(Reads aloud and writes on the board)</em> With your group, create something that would change the outcome of this story. Think about how you can use either light, sound, or movement to change the outcome of the story. </p>
                        <p><em>Pass out the This Is Not My Hat Brainstorming Graphic Organizer #2. Students just need one per group.</em></p>
                        <p>T: You are going to use this graphic organizer to plan out your change and the new outcome. Remember to answer each of the questions and fill in each box. Work together and use everyone’s ideas and input.<br>If you need help, raise your hand and one of the teachers will come to your group.</p>
                        <p>S: Using the This Is Not My Hat Brainstorming Graphic Organizer #2, students discuss and record how they could change the outcome of the story:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Write down the point(s) within the story where the lights would be used/occur.</li>
                            <li>Write down how the story would then differ, and thus cause a different outcome from the original after this point (tell the new version of the story starting from the point of change).</li>
                            <li>Fill out the plot diagram of their new story.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>When helping students, use some of these questions to prompt student groups: What would the new outcome be? How would this happen? What creation is needed to change to the plot to achieve this new outcome? At what point in the story does the creation come in to play? Do characters use this new device? Does a new setting occur? Does the changed outcome affect the mood and theme of the original setting?</p>

                    <span id="id17" typeof="Discussing">
                        <p>T: Yesterday we read This is Not My Hat, mapped out the story, and thought about how we might change the outcome of the story by using light, sound, or movement.</p>
                        <p>Today you are going to finish your This Is Not My Hat Brainstorming graphic organizer and decide upon how your group is going to meet the challenge of changing the outcome of the story and retelling the story.  </p>
                        <p>Here’s that challenge exactly: </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Using snap circuits, create something involving light, sound, or movement that would change the outcome of the story.</li>
                            <li>Create a video of this new retelling of the story.</li>
                        </ol>
                        <p><strong>T: Now, remember, the circuit you create to change the outcome of the story has to make sense within the story. </strong><br>For example, if you are going to use a light to change the outcome, you can’t just have a light appear out of nowhere in the ocean. A light would have to come from a lighthouse, or from a deep-sea fish that has a natural light, or from a scuba diver holding a flashlight, or a search light on a boat, or maybe the light from an alien ship, etc. This book is a fantasy (because fish don’t really talk and don’t really wear hats), but it is still grounded in some level of reality.<br>A movement in the water has to come from some source- another fish, a whirlpool, a boat, etc. Because this book is a fantasy (fish don’t really talk and don’t really wear hats), but it is still grounded in some level of reality.</p>
                        <p>T: So, by the end of today, your group will have decided the device you are going to use and  begun creating the materials for retelling the story with the new outcome.<br>Use the next 15 minutes to finish your This Is Not My Hat Brainstorming Graphic Organizer. If you have questions, raise your hand and one of the teachers will come to your group. Feel free to use the booklets in Snap Circuit sets for ideas.</p>
                        <p><em>Let students work for 15 minutes and circulate the room helping if needed. If students are finishing, encourage them to go ahead and build the device with their Snap Circuits.

                        <p>Every group will have a set of snap circuits and a box. The other materials you might want to use (construction paper, glue, staples, markers, etc.) you can find in the room. </p>

                        <p>Notes: The purpose of this activity is for students to think critically about their own retelling by analyzing and applying notions related to author style. </p>
                        <p>T: Today we are going to reread this story and discuss the way the author uses language in the story. Then you will spend some time working with your same group to revise writing your retelling of the story using some of the same techniques the author uses. </p>
                        <p>T: <em>(Begins reading the book aloud)</em> Before we begin reading, can anyone tell me what style means? So what do you think author’s style means?</p>
                        <p>T: Author’s style is the way the author uses words and constructs sentences to tell the story. Sometimes authors like to use really long sentences. [Show example.] Sometimes authors like to use very short sentences. [Show example.]  Sometimes authors use lots of descriptive words to create vivid images for their readers to see in their minds. [Show example.] And sometimes authors don’t give as many details so  readers can imagine the story on their own. [Show example.] Today while we read, I want you to pay attention to the words and sentences that Jon Klassen uses to tell the story. </p>
                        <p>Notes: Rely on several instructional strategies for them to understand author's style and how it applies to their efforts to retell their stories</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Pause after page 4 and ask: “What do you notice about the sentences the author is using so far?” Are they long or short? </li>
                            <li>Pause after page 12 and ask: “What do you notice about the sentences in these pages? Are there any patterns that you notice? Are any words used over and over again? Which ones?” </li>
                            <li>Pause after page 18 and ask: “What have you been noticing about the words the author uses? Does he give us lots of details or does he let us imagine the story on our own?”</li>
                            <li>Model some of the style and devices the author uses. Ask students to try some of them out on lined paper or a graphic organizer. </li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>And even if ______________________, he probably ________________________. </li>
                                <li>But I will _________________________. </li>
                                <li>So I ________________________________. </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>T: With your group, revise writing your retelling of the story and implement some of the style and devices the author uses into your writing.</p>
                            <p>Notes: Begin to revise their retelling by visiting each group and prompting them to incorporate the style and devices of the author (e.g., What part of the new story did you like? What part of the new story did you want more information or details? Does the retelling feel like it fits with the author’s writing?). Share their retelling with another group and get feedback (if time permits).</p>
